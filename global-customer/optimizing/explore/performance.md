# Optimizing Explore - Performance

[AZURE.INCLUDE [header](../../../includes/optimizing-explore.md)]

## Performance Testing

During this stage, you will probably be conducting performance tests to fine-tune or optimize your application. To be more realistic when conducting your performance tests, the following are a few recommendations that will help:
 
- Conduct your performance testing in China Standard Time, instead of your own time zone.
- Conduct testing in China within the Great Firewall, this will better reflect the response times and the real user experience.
- Conduct during the internet rush hours in order to measure the performance of your application under high workloads.
