Azure is built on the premise that for you to control your own customer data in the cloud, you require visibility into that data. You must know where it is stored. You must also know, through clearly stated and readily available policies and procedures, how we help secure your customer data, who can access it and under what circumstances. And you can review the third-party audits and certifications.

In clear, straightforward language,the [Microsoft Azure Operated by 21Vianet Privacy Statement](/support/legal/privacy-statement) describes the details of the data protection policies and practices that govern customer data in Azure and its location, use of subcontractors, disclosure of data and related issues.

## You know where and how your data is stored and used

21Vianet seeks to give Azure customers control over where their customer data is stored in an ever-expanding network of data centers around the globe, balanced with the need to store backups at multiple locations in case of a disaster.

21Vianet operates Azure in data centers located exclusively in mainland China.

Customers may specify the region(s) of the datacenters in which Customer Data will be stored. Available regions are shown below.

|REGION|
|---|
|China (East) (located in Shanghai)|
|China (North) (located in Beijing )|

* We may transfer Customer Data between regions for data redundancy or other purposes. For example, Azure replicates Blob and Table data between two regions within China for enhanced data durability in case of a major data center disaster.
* Our suppliers (including Microsoft, which provides the Azure technology on which our service runs) do not have logical or physical access to Customer Data. In limited circumstances, we may authorize a supplier to access systems containing Customer Data when necessary to help troubleshoot a customer support incident or address technical issues. We will grant such access only for the duration necessary to resolve the issue. We carefully monitor the access given and terminate the access when the issue is resolved.
* We do not control or limit the regions from which customers or their end users may access Customer Data.

We will use Customer Data only to provide you the Services. This use may include troubleshooting to prevent, find and fix problems with the operation of the Services. It may also include improving features for finding and protecting against threats to users. We will not use Customer Data or derive information from it for any advertising or other commercial purposes without your consent.

## Remote access to customer data
21Vianet ensures that appropriate personnel are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Such personnel may access customer data to provide customer support, troubleshoot the service, or comply with legal requirements.

* 21Vianet personnel adhere to stringent privacy practices to safeguard customer data.
* 21Vianet imposes strict requirements around legal demands for customer data.
* 21Vianet does not control or limit the locations in China mainland from which customers or their end users may access Customer Data.

## You know who can access your data and under what conditions

21Vianet offer clear policies and guidelines that cover who can access your Azure customer data and when. The operational processes and controls that govern access to customer data in Azure are rigorously maintained and regularly verified by accredited audit firms.

**You control who has access to your customer data.** Strong authentication, including the use of multi-factor authentication, helps limit access to authorized personnel only.

**If law enforcement or another third party asks 21Vianet for Customer Data**, 21Vianet believes that its customers should control their own information whether stored on their premises or in a cloud service. Accordingly, we will not disclose Customer Data to a third party (excluding our suppliers and subcontractors) except as you direct or as required by applicable law and regulations. If compelled to disclose Customer Data to a third party, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited. Should a third party contact us with a complaint about your use of the Services (for example, allegation of infringement by you or your End User), we may ask the third party to contact you directly and may provide your basic contact information to the third party.

## You can audit Azure standards certifications

Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet partners with customers to help them address regulatory requirements. By providing customers with compliant, independently verified cloud services, we make it easier for customers to achieve compliance for the infrastructure and applications they run in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet. We provide customers with information about our security and compliance programs, to help customers assess our services against their own legal and regulatory requirements.
