**1.What role does Microsoft play in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet?**

Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet is a separate instance of Microsoft's Azure platform located in mainland China and independently operated and sold by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. It is based on the same Azure technology that powers Microsoft's global cloud service with the same service levels to customers.

As a customer of Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet, you get:

* A cloud service hosted in data centers exclusively in mainland China and operated independently by 21Vianet, a leading Chinese Internet data center provider.
* Powered by world-class Azure technology built on Microsoft's extensive experience with online services and used by enterprise customers around the world.

**2.Is Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet compliant with my regulatory requirements?**

It is ultimately your obligation to comply with your regulatory requirements. We provide you with information to help you do so. We commit to compliance with data protection and privacy laws generally applicable to IT service providers. If you are subject to industry or jurisdictional requirements, you will need to make your own assessment of your ability to comply. Customers in many industries and geographies have found they can use Azure in a manner that complies with applicable regulations, provided they utilize the services in a manner appropriate to their particular circumstances.

**3.How will 21Vianet use the information I store in Azure?**

21Vianet will use the Customer Data you store in Azure only to provide you with the Azure service.

It's your data, and you retain the rights to it. 21Vianet will not use Customer Data or derive information from it for any advertising or similar commercial purposes. 21Vianet will only use Customer Data for purposes compatible with providing the services, In addition to day-to-day operations, such purposes can includes using Customer Data for the following:

* Troubleshooting aimed at preventing, detecting and repairing problems affecting the operation of services.
* Ongoing improvement of features such as those that involve the detection of, and protection against, emerging and evolving threats to the services or Customer Data (such as malware or spam).
* Providing personalized or inference-based service features.

**4.What happens if law enforcement or another third party asks 21Vianet for Customer Data?**

21Vianet believes that its customers should control their own information whether stored on their premises or in a cloud service. Accordingly, we will not disclose Customer Data to a third party (excluding our suppliers and subcontractors) except as you direct or as required by applicable law and regulations. If compelled to disclose Customer Data to a third party, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited. Should a third party contact us with a complaint about your use of the Services (for example, allegation of infringement by you or your End User), we may ask the third party to contact you directly and may provide your basic contact information to the third party.

**5.In what circumstances is Customer Data disclosed to subcontractors, and how do they use it?**

21Vianet may hire other companies to provide limited services on its behalf. 21Vianet will only disclose Customer Data to subcontractors so they can deliver the services we have retained them to provide. Subcontractors are prohibited from using Customer Data for any other purpose, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. Subcontractors that work in facilities or on equipment controlled by 21Vianet must follow our privacy standards. All other subcontractors must follow privacy standards equivalent to our own.

**6.Does 21Vianet allow customers to audit Azure operations or its data centers?**

No. Our independent audits and certifications are shared with customers in lieu of individual customer audits. These certifications and attestations accurately represent how we obtain and meet our security and compliance objectives, and serve as a practical mechanism to validate our promises for all customers. Allowing potentially thousands of customers to audit our services would not be a scalable practice and might compromise security and privacy. Our independent third-party validation program includes audits that are conducted on an annual basis to provide verification of Azure security controls.

**7.Can 21Vinaet customize its audit for me?**

No. 21Vianet is not able to agree to custom audit obligations for individual customers. The costs and potential conflicts between varying obligations make it impractical to customize audits.

**8.Does Azure data-mine my data for advertising?**

No. We do not mine Customer Data for advertising or share Customer Data with advertiser-supported services.

**9.Where is my Customer Data stored? Will 21Vianet share it with other companies?**

Customer Data will be stored only in data centers located in mainland China. In limited circumstances, 21Vianet may authorize one of its affiliates, suppliers or subcontractors located outside China to access Customer Data when necessary to troubleshoot a customer support incident or address a technical issue. We carefully monitor such access and terminate the access when the issue is resolved.

**10.Will Microsoft have access to my Customer Data?**

No. Microsoft does not have access to Customer Data except in limited circumstances where 21Vianet requires technical assistance from Microsoft to troubleshoot a customer support incident or address a technical issue. 21Vianet will grant such access only for the duration necessary to resolve the issue. 21Vianet carefully monitors the access given and terminates the access when the issue is resolved.

**11.Does 21Vianet have access to the Azure service that Microsoft operates globally outside China?**

No. Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet in China is physically and logically separate from the Azure service operated by Microsoft in the rest of the world. Just as Microsoft does not have access to Customer Data in 21Vianet's service (except to assist 21Vianet as detailed above), 21Vianet does not have access to Customer Data in Microsoft's service outside China. For clarity, the Azure data center in Hong Kong is part of the global service operated by Microsoft, not the 21Vianet service operated in mainland China.

**12.Where can I learn more about the privacy practices that apply to Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet?**

The [Microsoft Azure Operated by 21Vianet Privacy Statement](/support/legal/privacy-statement/) describes the specific privacy policy and practices that govern customers'use of Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.
