#SLA for CDN

We guarantee that at least 99.9% of the time CDN will respond to client requests and deliver the requested content without error. We will review and accept data from any commercially reasonable independent measurement system that you choose to monitor your content. You must select a set of agents from the measurement system's list of standard agents that are generally available and represent at least five geographically diverse locations in major People Republic of China metropolitan areas.


##Introduction
 

This Service Level Agreement for Azure (this “SLA”) is made by 21Vianet in connection with, and is a part of, the agreement under which Customer has purchased Azure Services from 21Vianet (the “Agreement”).

We provide financial backing to our commitment to achieve and maintain Service Levels for our Services. If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of your monthly service fees. These terms will be fixed for term of your Agreement. If a subscription is renewed, the version of this SLA that is current at the time the renewal term commences will apply throughout the renewal term. We will provide at least 90 days' notice for adverse material changes to this SLA. You can review the most current version of this SLA at any time by visiting [http://www.azure.cn/support/legal/sla/](/support/legal/sla/).

##The SLA details
 

###Monthly Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for CDN Service
1. 21Vianet is not responsible for comprehensive monitoring of customer content; this responsibility lies with customer. 21Vianet will review data from any commercially reasonable independent measurement system used by Customer.

2. Customer must select a set of agents from the measurement system's list of standard agents that are generally available and represent at least five major metropolitan areas in the People's Republic of China. 

	1) Measurement System tests (frequency of at least one test per hour per agent) will be configured to perform one HTTP(S) GET operation according to the model below: 

	2) A test file will be placed on Customer's origin (e.g., Azure Storage account).

	3) The GET operation will retrieve the file through the CDN Service, by requesting the object from the appropriate Azure domain name hostname.

	4) The test file will meet the following criteria: 

	- The test object will meet CDN caching specifications. For example, the response header should not include 'set-cookie' ; cache-control attributes cannot be set to 'private' or 'no-cache' ; the 'expires' value cannot be set at a past time value.

	- The test object will be a file at least 50KB in size and no larger than 1MB. 

	- Raw data will be trimmed to eliminate any measurements that came from an agent experiencing technical problems during the measurement period. 

	Remarks: 

	- In the event test results should reveal issues, please contact us as soon as possible so that we may verify said test results at first opportunity in order to locate the causes for these issues.

	- If the chosen test source itself contains problematic links, this will cause anomalies in the test results; these anomalies should be excluded when calculating the final availability value.

3. "Monthly Uptime Percentage" is the percentage of HTTP transactions in which the CDN responds to client requests and delivers the requested content without error. Monthly Uptime Percentage of the CDN Service is calculated as the number of times the object was delivered successfully divided by the total number of requests (after removing erroneous data).

4. The following Service Levels and Service Credits are applicable to Customer's use of the CDN Service:

Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit  
---|---  
<99.9% | 5%   
<99% | 20%
