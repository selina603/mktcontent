#SLA for Site Recovery

For each Protected Instance configured for On-Premises-to-On-Premises Failover, we guarantee at least 99.9% availability of the Site Recovery service.

For each Protected Instance configured for On-Premises-to-Azure planned and unplanned Failover, we guarantee a four-hour Recovery Time Objective for unencrypted Protected Instances, and a six-hour Recovery Time Objective for encrypted Protected Instance, depending on the size of the Protected Instance.


##Introduction
 

This Service Level Agreement for Azure (this “SLA”) is made by 21Vianet in connection with, and is a part of, the agreement under which Customer has purchased Azure Services from 21Vianet (the “Agreement”).

We provide financial backing to our commitment to achieve and maintain Service Levels for our Services. If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of your monthly service fees. These terms will be fixed for term of your Agreement. If a subscription is renewed, the version of this SLA that is current at the time the renewal term commences will apply throughout the renewal term. We will provide at least 90 days' notice for adverse material changes to this SLA. You can review the most current version of this SLA at any time by visiting [http://www.azure.cn/support/legal/sla/](/support/legal/sla/).

##The SLA details
 

###Additional Definitions
1. "**Failover**" is the process of transferring control, either simulated or actual, of a Protected Instance from a primary site to a secondary site. 

2. "**On-Premises-to-Azure Failover**" is the Failover of a Protected Instance from a non-Azure primary site to an Azure secondary site. Customer may designate a particular Azure datacenter as a secondary site, provided that if Failover to the designated datacenter is not possible, 21Vianet may replicate to a different datacenter in the same region. 

3. "**On-Premises-to-On-Premises Failover**" is the Failover of a Protected Instance from a non-Azure primary site to a non-Azure secondary site.

4. "**Protected Instance**" refers to a virtual or physical machine configured for replication by the Site Recovery Service from a primary site to a secondary site. Protected Instances are enumerated in the Protected Items tab in the Recovery Services section of the Management Portal.

###Monthly Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for On-Premises-to-On-Premises Failover
1. "**Maximum Available Minutes**" is the total number of minutes that a given Protected Instance has been configured for On-Premises-to-On-Premises replication by the Site Recovery Service during a billing month.

2. "**Failover Minutes**" is the total number of minutes in a billing month during which a Failover of a Protected Instance configured for On-Premises-to-On-Premises replication has been attempted but not completed.

3. "**Downtime**" is the total accumulated Failover Minutes in which the Failover of a Protected Instance is unsuccessful due to unavailability of the Site Recovery Service, provided that retries are continually attempted no less frequently than once every thirty minutes. 

4. "**Monthly Uptime Percentage**" for On-Premises-to-On-Premises Failover of a specific Protected Instance in a given billing month is calculated as Maximum Available Minutes less Downtime divided by Maximum Available Minutes. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:

		Monthly Uptime % =   (Maximum Available Minutes − Downtime) / Maximum Available Minutes 

5. The following Service Levels and Service Credits are applicable to Customer's use of each Protected Instance within the Site Recovery Service for On-Premises-to-On-Premises Failover:

Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit  
---|---  
<99.9%  | 10%  
<99% | 25% 

###Monthly Recovery Time Objective and Service Levels for On-Premises-to-Azure Failover
1. "**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**" means the period of time beginning when Customer initiates a Failover of a Protected Instance experiencing either a planned or unplanned outage for On-Premises-to-Azure replication to the time when the Protected Instance is running as a virtual machine in Azure, excluding any time associated with manual action or the execution of Customer scripts. 

2. "**Monthly Recovery Time Objective**" for a specific Protected Instance configured for On-Premises-to-Azure replication in a given billing month is four hours for an unencrypted Protected Instance and six hours for an encrypted Protected Instance. One hour will be added to the monthly Recovery Time Objective for each additional 25GB over the initial 100GB Protected Instance size. 

3. The following Service Levels and Service Credits are applicable to Customer's use of each Protected Instance within the Site Recovery Service for On-Premises-to-Azure Failover, assuming Protected Instance sizes of 100GB or less:

Protected Instance Monthly | Recovery Time Objective | Service Credit  
---|---|---  
Unencrypted | > 4 hours | 100%  
Encrypted | > 6 hours | 100%
