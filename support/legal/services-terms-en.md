# Azure Services Terms

## Acceptable Use Policy

Neither you nor those that access the Services through you may use the Services:

* in a way prohibited by law, regulation, governmental order or decree;
* to violate the rights of others;
* to use the Services to try to gain unauthorized access to or disrupt any service, data, account or network by any means; 
* to falsify any protocol or email header information (e.g., “spoofing”); 
* to spam or distribute malware;
* in a way that could harm the Services or impair anyone else’s use of them;
* or for any high risk use (where failure or fault of the Services could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage).

## Virtual Machines

The Virtual Machine feature provides you with the ability to run a virtual server with one of several operating systems of your choice. You may upload your own Virtual Machine image or choose from pre-configured Virtual Machine images available from Microsoft or third parties.

You agree to secure the rights necessary to run all software (including the operating system) within your Virtual Machine. You are responsible for patching, configuring and maintaining the operating system and other software within your Virtual Machine. You may not disable, tamper with or otherwise attempt to circumvent any billing mechanism that tracks your hourly use of the Virtual Machine and the software contained therein.

Azure may provide you with the option of running Windows Server and other Microsoft software in a Virtual Machine. You may use such software only within the Azure online service and only in conjunction with your permitted use of any applicable Azure role. You have no other rights under these license terms to run the software (e.g., you may not run copies on your on-premise servers unless you separately obtain the license to do so).

## Windows Server

Use of any Virtual Machine containing any version of Windows Server is subject to the following additional terms:

**Limitations on Use.** You may not use the following functionality in the software:

* Remote Desktop Services
* Rights Management Services

**Hosting.** If you use the software to host a solution to be accessed or used by third parties, then that solution must consist of an application or service that is owned or licensed by you or a third party.

**Data Storage Technology.** The server software includes data storage technology called Windows Internal Database or Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine for Windows. Components of the server software use these technologies to store data. You may not otherwise use or access these technologies under these license terms.

**Icons, images, sounds.** While the software is running, you may use but not share its icons, images, sounds, and media. The sample images, sounds and media provided with the software are for your non-commercial use only.

**Data Transfer Notices.** The notices applicable to Windows Server, as identified in the Data Transfer Notices document at [http://microsoft.com/licensing/contracts](http://microsoft.com/licensing/contracts) apply to the use of Windows Server software under your Azure licenses.

**Validation.**

The software will from time to time update or require download of the validation feature of the software. Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. Validation also permits you to use certain features of the software, or to obtain additional benefits. For more information, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=39157](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=39157).

During a validation check, the software will send information about the software and device to Microsoft. This information includes the version and product key of the software, and the Internet protocol address of the device. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. For more information about validation and what is sent during a validation check, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=96551](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=96551).

If the software is not properly licensed, the functionality of the software may be affected. For example, you may need to reactivate the software, or receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software, or you may not be able to obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft.

You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=96552](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=96552).

**Potentially Unwanted Software (Notice I)**

If turned on, Windows Defender will search your computer for “spyware,” “adware” and other potentially unwanted software. If it finds potentially unwanted software, the software will ask you if you want to ignore, disable (quarantine) or remove it. Any potentially unwanted software rated “high” or “severe” will automatically be removed after scanning unless you change the default setting. Removing or disabling potentially unwanted software may result in other software on your computer ceasing to work or your breaching a license to use other software on your computer.

By using this software, it is possible that you will also remove or disable software that is not potentially unwanted software.
