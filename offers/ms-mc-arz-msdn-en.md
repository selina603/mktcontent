#Offer Details

###Azure Operated by 21Vianet

##MSDN Subscriptions Azure Benefit Offer

Azure provides great development and test benefits for MSDN subscribers. Benefits include a one-time credit specified by your MSDN subscription, lower rates and no additional charge for using MSDN software on Azure for development and test. If your purpose is for commercial use, please convert to [Standard Pay-In-Advance](https://www.azure.cn/offers/ms-mc-arz-33p/) subscription.

##Flexibility with Azure Credits

This offer is for a limited subscription available only by invitation to active MSDN subscribers. One offer per customer. After paying a nominal fee of 1RMB and completing the registration, you will receive a fixed amount of Azure credits. The Azure credits are good for 12 months or until exhausted, whichever comes first.

The credit amount varies by MSDN subscription level:

 - Visual Studio Enterprise (subscriber benefit)：11,200 RMB
 - MSDN Platforms (subscriber benefit)：7,500RMB
 - Visual Studio Test Professional (subscriber benefit)：3,800 RMB
 - Visual Studio Professional (subscriber benefit)：3,800 RMB

The choice is yours on how you use your Azure credits for development and test. Use them on any Azure services that meet your needs including Virtual Machines, Websites, Cloud Services, Mobile Services, Storage, SQL Database, HDInsight, Media Services, and many more.

You may use up to the amount of your Azure credits for the duration specified. If you exceed your credits, your service will be disabled. Any unused credits at the end of 12 months will be forfeited unless you convert to a [Standard Pay-In-Advance](https://www.azure.cn/offers/ms-mc-arz-33p/) Offer prior to the expiration of your MSDN Benefit Offer. You may not purchase additional Azure credits with this offer, but you may purchase a separate Standard Pay-In-Advance subscription and then transfer your Customer Data.

This Azure offering is for active MSDN subscribers only and is invitation-only. MSDN subscribers will be provided with an Azure subscription that includes the services detailed below. This subscription should be used for development and test purposes only, is not intended for production use, and does not include any warranty or SLA. We are making this capacity available to MSDN subscribers on a best efforts basis; there is no guarantee of capacity availability.

If you use up the allotted credit or at the end of the offer duration (whichever comes first), your subscription will be disabled and your Customer Data will be permanently deleted unless you add more funds within 90 days. This will re-activate your Azure subscription but may require re-configuration of related services. 

##Additional Benefits

###Virtualize with Lower Rates

Speed up your development and test using Azure virtual machines. MSDN subscribers receive discounted hourly rates. That’s not all. Stop your virtual machines and we will stop billing them within a minute.


###Discounted Hourly Rates

All instances for Windows and Windows Server Virtual Machines, Cloud Services, Websites, and HDInsight are discounted off the Standard Pay In Advance rates. The MSDN rate on these services is equal to the rate for a Linux virtual machine of the same size and type.

You will be notified at least 30 days in advance of any changes to the rates.

Any taxes which may result from receiving services at no charge are the sole responsibility of the recipient.

You must have an active MSDN subscription and utilize an Org ID account associated with that subscription. You must maintain an active MSDN subscription to enjoy the MSDN Azure benefit. This offer is limited to one per subscriber.


###Exclusions

Azure credits may not be used to purchase Azure support plans, third-party branded products, or products otherwise sold separately from Azure.

###Use Rights

The MSDN Azure benefit is intended for development and test purposes only. Usage within the Azure MSDN subscription does not carry a financially-backed SLA. We reserve the right to suspend any instance (VM or cloud service) that runs continuously for more than 120 hours or if we determine that the instance is being used for production. Production workloads must be run on a Standard Pay-In-Advance Offer.
