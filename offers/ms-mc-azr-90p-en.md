#Offer Details

### Azure Operated by 21Vianet

##Windows Server Essentials Customers Offer 

###Flexibility with Azure Credits

Discover the benefits of the Azure Backup service using this trial offer. Sign up now and you will enjoy access to a simple and fast method to back up your data. Take advantage of the credit supplied to start securing your data in our China-based datacenters. Restore your data in a matter of minutes and avoid IT risks such as hardware break or data loss for your business. 

As an eligible customer, for an initial 1 RMB payment you will receive up to 2000 RMB of Azure monetary credits to use on the Azure Backup Service for up to 3 months.

If you spend 2,000 RMB or at the end of the third month (whichever comes first), your subscription will be disabled and your Customer Data will be permanently deleted unless you add more funds within 90 days as detailed in Conversion to Paid Offer below. This will re-activate your subscription but may require re-configuration of related services.

This offer is limited to one offer per new customer. Violation of this policy may result in termination of your subscription, deletion of all Customer Data, and forfeiture of the 1 RMB payment.

###Conversion to Paid Offer

You may convert your trial subscription into a [Standard Pay-In-Advance](https://www.azure.cn/offers/ms-mc-arz-33p/) subscription by adding additional funds of 1,000 RMB or more. Your Azure Credits will be increased by the amount of the additional funds you add and are valid for 12 months. You may make subsequent additions of funds that will be valid for 12 months from the date of purchase, but this will not extend Azure Credits previously purchased and any Azure Credits not used within 12 months of their purchase will be forfeited.

###Payment Options & Pricing Details

A 1 RMB payment will be required via Ali Pay and China UnionPay (CUP) only.

More details on pricing and billing, including the prices for individual Azure features, can be found on our [Pricing page](https://www.azure.cn/offers/ms-mc-arz-33p/).

###Cancelation Policy
