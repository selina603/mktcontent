# Refactor Migration Scenario

You may want your new applications on Azure China to be migrated from other cloud providers, and would also like to look for solutions for a better and faster migration to Azure China.
 
We recommend using Azure Site Recovery (ASR) for migrating VMs from other cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Ali Cloud) to Azure China. ASR is the site recovery solution that provides not just simple, automated disaster recovery for Azure, but also allows migrating your VMs (both VMware and Hyper-V) from other cloud providers.

Please refer to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/
for detailed information on ASR and https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/site-recovery-migrate-aws-to-azure/ for migrating Windows VMs from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure.
