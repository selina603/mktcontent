## Azure Solution Partners

**1. Availability of Global Partner Solutions**

On Global Azure, you have the Global Partner Solutions available at the Azure Marketplace (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/), which is your online store for thousands of certified, open-source and community software applications, developer services, and data — pre-configured for Microsoft Azure. 
 
However, these solutions are pre-configured for Global Azure, not for China Azure. For any solution that you have used in your Global Azure deployment, you have to find a replacement when you migrate to China Azure.

**2. Local China Partner Solutions**

You can find a list of certified partners for China Azure at https://www.azure.cn/partnerancasestudy/partner/. Here, they can help you find localized partner solutions based on your requirements.

There is a Marketplace in China Azure, similar to the Global Azure Marketplace, which is currently in Public Preview at https://market.azure.cn/. The China Azure Marketplace is an online store for highly optimized and integrated applications and services ready to deploy on China Azure. The following screenshot is the public preview of the China Azure Marketplace.
