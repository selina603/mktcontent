# Playbook Overview

## Introduction

In the world of digital retailing and booming cross-border e-commerce, all eyes are on China.  We have received unmatched interest for Azure in China and enjoyed triple digits revenue and utilization growth year over year. As of now, we are still the only Cloud platform provider in China with pervasive global footprint and have been regarded to be highly trustworthy. Many Global customers have shown interest to setup their cloud presence to China, they already may have a vast footprint on Public Azure and are looking towards rehost, refactor, and/or rebuild some/all of their applications or services to China using Azure China.

Azure China is the first sovereign cloud operated by a third party entity (21Vianet), and completely isolated from Public Azure.  The complexities and the unique internet environment and policies in China introduce many frictions when customers planning or working on such project  including policies (government), performance (networking), parity (services), and partner (ecosystem).

Today, the China Customer Advisory Team (China CAT) comprising of technical and business experts, assists and enables such customer requests by handholding the very complex and tediously manual process of migrating or integrating customers’ applications and services between sovereign clouds i.e. Public Azure to Azure China (operated by 21Vianet). The team helps in end to end process by being involved right from assessment, proving, planning, implementing, and validating. In additional to support by escalations to China CAT team, we also in accountable to setup The Global Connection Center, which is centered around Azure China as migration target, aims to provide customer a one-stop-shop for advisory and tools needed technically, legally and financially.

The Global Connection Center consists of two parts:

- **The Global Customer Playbook** is a step by step guide as well as a troubleshooting wizard to help Business decision makers/IT admins/Solution Architects to fully comprehend the proper procedures to setup services in Azure China as well issues that may come up during the process and how to resolve them with minimum efforts. Regulatory considerations, Azure China technology platform, Azure China partner solution offerings, application and service migration guidance such as design patterns samples and scenario based tips are some of the topics covered in depth.

- **The Global Connection Toolkit** is an open source toolkit available on GitHub. The intuitive toolkit will help all Public Azure customers to assess, evaluate and experiment the Azure China environment in terms of cost and migration complexities, as well as to perform the actual migration process.

Both the Global Customer Playbook and the Global Connection Toolkit will continue to be updated with more migration scenarios and design patterns, with the intention of staying aligned with the ever-changing customer needs and the new service landing status of China Azure.
