# FAQ

## How is Azure China different from Azure Global?

Microsoft Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet, is a separate instance of Microsoft's Azure cloud services located in mainland China and independently operated and sold by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of [Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd.](http://www.ch.21vianet.com/) It is based on the same Azure technology that powers Microsoft's global cloud services with comparable service levels to customers.

However, as [Azure China](http://www.azure.cn) is a separate instance of Azure, there will be differences in the availability of Azure services, compared to that of [Azure Global](http://www.azure.com).  You can refer to [Parity](/solutions/global-customer/envisioning/guidance/parity/) for a service parity comparison.

## What is the Great Firewall of China?

The Great Firewall of China (GFW) used by international, including Chinese, media to refer to legislation and projects initiated by the Chinese government (which is controlled by the Communist Party of China, CPC) that attempt to regulate the Internet in Mainland China. It is the main instrument to achieve Internet censorship in China. These CPC regulations include criminalizing certain online speech and activities, blocking from view selected websites, and filtering key words out of searches initiated from computers located in Mainland China.
