# Envisioning Explore - Parity

[AZURE.INCLUDE [header](../../../../mktcontent/includes/envisioning-explore.md)]

## China Azure (Mooncake) Services

Microsoft Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet, is a separate instance of Microsoft's Azure cloud services located in mainland China and independently operated and sold by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of [Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd](http://www.ch.21vianet.com/) . It is based on the same Azure technology that powers Microsoft's global cloud services with comparable service levels to customers.

However, as China Azure or Mooncake is a separate instance of Azure, there will be differences in the availability of Azure services, compared to that of Global Azure.
 
Details on services available on Mooncake can be found here: [https://www.azure.cn/home/features/what-is-azure/](https://www.azure.cn/home/features/what-is-azure/).
You can also refer to [Parity](/solutions/global-customer/envisioning/guidance/parity/) for a service parity comparison.
