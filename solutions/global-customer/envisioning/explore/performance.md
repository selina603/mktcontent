# Envisioning Explore - Performance

[AZURE.INCLUDE [header](../../../../mktcontent/includes/envisioning-explore.md)]

## The Great Firewall

The effects of internet regulation in China - widely referred to as the 'Great Firewall' - can affect whether your website or any web services you provided on the Internet can be seen or used by your intended Chinese audience.

Unless your Chinese website/web services is hosted at an appropriate location, your website may be:

- Blocked altogether
- Blocked some of the time
- Extremely slowly when loading

The China government-managed firewall, officially termed the "Golden Shield Project", is designed to monitor and control the content viewed by Chinese internet users. If a website contains any content deemed inappropriate by the Chinese government, it will be blocked by the Great Firewall.

Since all network connectivity in or outside of China must go through the Great Firewall, if you are in China accessing a site outside of China, or you are outside of China accessing a site in China, you may experience some unpredictability in network performance.

If you want to know more about how server hosting may be impacted, please refer to [Service Hosting Options](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionCenter/blob/master/PlayBook/Envisioning/Guidance/Performance.md).
