# Migration Assistant

## Global Connection Toolkit

The goal of Azure Global Connection Toolkit is to connect different national clouds and to eliminate the friction to migrate applications between the national clouds.

Typically, migration / integration between different Cloud environment has three phases:

1. **Plan**: During this phase, users are required to investigate the differences between different cloud environments e.g. Azure Global vs. Azure China/Azure Germany. Differences in terms of costs and services parity, as well as risks, unfamiliarity and uncertainty in the new environment, causes the time and efforts required for migration planning to increase. 

1. **Validate**: User also required to validate if their services will be able to run in the targeted environment. Usually we need to conduct proof of concept or lots of researches in order to understand the limitations and constraints of the new environment. The difficulties to get and use a trial account also block users from moving ahead.

1. **Migrate**:  After planning and validation have been completed, user needs to investigate how to migrate/clone their current workloads to the new environment. The complexity of technologies blocks user from performing a migration in short period of time.

In order to help users in each step, Azure Global Connection Toolkit offers two components:

- **Assessment Tool**: Assessment Tool is a quick and simple tool to generate report and to answer FAQ when migrating Azure Services between different Azure cloud environments. Information to be provided in the assessment report includes items such as services parity, cost estimations and important considerations etc. The assessment tool is a PowerShell Module to allow user to perform assessment on their Azure Global subscription to generate plans and validation reports to assist their migration planning tasks.

- **CICD Tool**: The CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) Tool is a quick and simple tool to perform the actual migration through PowerShell scripts. For example, you can leverage the CI/CD tool to migrate your VMs from Azure East Asia region to Azure China East region. The toolkit will sync your metadata and configuration between the source and the destination subscriptions, so that everything will be the same as the original after the migration has been completed. Moreover, the PowerShell scripts generated by the tool can be freely customized or integrated into your existing DevOps process.
