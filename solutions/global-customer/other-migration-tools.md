Tools for the migration of IaaS resources or Virtual Machines (VMs) from classic (ASM) to Resource Manager (ARM) was launched publicly in early 2016. You can find the details by clicking on the following links below:

If you have classic ASM IaaS resources, it is highly recommended that you first migrate them to ARM before moving them to China Azure.
